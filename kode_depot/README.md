KodeDepot is an experiemental tool for generating minimalistic single file libraries that integrate seamlessly with your code base.  The tool parses a directory of source files and creates a database knowledgable about the dependieces of each of the parsed function calls.  You can then create projects and easily add these functions or data structures to single file libraries automaticly.
